- 👋 Hi, I’m @ochavirar
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, reading, programming and socializing with the people I care the most.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures in C language, web development, databses, algorithms, as well as learning th efoundations of SFML. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require some low-level knowledge (which is the area that I have practiced the most). I am also interested in learning other programming paradigms and languages.
